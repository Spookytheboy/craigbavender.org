						One of the best leadership principles texts I've ever encountered. I will probably revisit this book more than once a year. I'm of the opinion that all leaders need to listen through these stories and apply each of them to their teams.

					<b>Modern CTO</b></br>
					Author: Joel Beasley</br>
					Link: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-CTO-Joel-Beasley/dp/0692076069">Amazon</a></br>
					Thoughts:<br>
					<span class="thoughts">
						This served a ton of useful information on leadership and best practices when heading in a CTO direction. As someone whose worked within a startup setting without "formal" leadership, this book helped me navigate some pretty unfamiliar waters, and helped bolster professional confidence in a way that's helped me stand on the shoulders of giants.

					<b>Leviathan Wakes</b></br>
					Author: James S. A. Corey</br>
					Link: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leviathan-Wakes-James-S-Corey/dp/0316129089">Amazon</a></br>
					Thoughts:<br>

						Sci-fi noir meets space adventure / mystery horror? I was recommended this by a friend and glad I did. The book alternates chapter to chapter between two main characters, who of course later meet up and the story coincides... but... jeez. Excellent book. Fast read.

					<b>Caliban's War</b></br>
					Author: James S. A. Corey</br>
					Link: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Calibans-War-Expanse-James-Corey/dp/0316129062">Amazon</a></br>
					Thoughts:<br>
					<span class="thoughts">
						Book two of The Expanse series, second to Leviathan Wakes. Excellent so far. I miss the toggling character-chapter format like book 1, as this book has about 5-6 characters it alternates chapter context between, but the story continues and it's another excellent addition. Probably reading book 3 shortly after.
