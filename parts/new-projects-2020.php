		<h1>Update - New Projects!</h1>
		<p><span class="faded">May 30, 2020</span></p>
		
		<p>After a long winter and recent move into my own apartment, I've started to successfully invest some time into personal projects. Trying to mostly focus on creative endeavors, and only work on things that genuinely interest me, as well as provide avenues to explore new tech and/or provide a service.</p>

		<p>–</p>

		<p>Most recently, I spent 3-4hrs Friday night of May 29th compiling a customer timer project, using Javascript, HTML, and AJAX to control time. I opted to use AJAX calls to "getTime()" because server-side time will be absolutely accurate. Javascript (client-side) time can be manipulated and progress faster/slower depending on the user's hardware load. The project calls a server to get time, runs a quick diff calculation, and displays the time remaining based on the specifics of this project.</p>

		<p>It's <i>incredibly</i> niche, and I honestly just built it for myself so I could embed the timer on stream + didn't have to use my phone. You can see more about the project here: <a href="https://craigbavender.org/projects/cerberustimer/" target="_blank">Cerberus "No Ghosts" Method Timer</a>.</p>

		<p>–</p>

		<p>A few Sundays ago, I tweeted out stating my intentions to study a bit of game development, and embark on a custom project of my own. The entire reason I went into College studying Computer Science was that one day, my intention was to build my own games.</p>

		<p>This something I'm very passionate about, and really honestly want for myself to accomplish. You can hold me accountable to that. You can also follow my progress via a Twitter thread I've started covering the project: <a href="https://twitter.com/spookytheboy/status/1259966655691550720?s=20" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		
		<p>–</p>

		<p>That's all for now. I'm doing well and looking forward to what the future holds. Trying to get more sleep, do more yoga, and drink more water.</p>

		<p>If you're reading this, I hope you're doing well.</p>
