		<p>Enderalters.com served as a web presence for my 2013 â€“ 2014 time spent altering Magic: The Gathering cards for clients. Commissions were primarily collected through Reddit using the username "PrinceEnder." I was able to build the site the fall semester of my senior year during a web programming class as a project.</p>

		<p>The site itself wasn't interesting. There isn't a backup of it available that I'm able to locate, nor was the final version captured via archive.net.</p>

		<p>Painting on cards paid my rent in college.</p>
